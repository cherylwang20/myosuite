Prosthesis Table Tennis
--------------------------------------------------------------

Task Description: Using a paddle, the agent must hit a pingpong ball such that the ball lands on the opponent's side. This task requires coordination of a 
'myoArm' model and a 'myoTorso' model as to allow the agent to accurately hit the pingpong ball without missing and allowing enough force so that the ball 
reaches within the dimensions of the opponent's side.

Objective
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To develop a general policy to  engage in a high-speed rally against an AI opponent. 
Move the object from the agent's side to the opponent's side by hitting the ball with a paddle.



Action Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The action space includes three major parts, the :ref:`myoArm`, consisting of 63 muscles, the `myoArm`, consisting of 210 muscles 
and two position actuators for pelvis translation in the x,y plane. 

The action for the prosthetic hand is controlled in terms of each joint angle. A normalisation is applied such that all joint angle in radiance can be 
actuated by a control value between  :math:`[-1, 1]`, with -1 and 1 representing the lower and upper bound of the range of motions.

.. _challenge25_table_tennis_locomotion:


Prosthesis Locomotion
---------------------------------




A trans-femoral :ref:`myoLeg` model and a Open Source Leg (`OSL <https://neurobionics.robotics.umich.edu/research/wearable-robotics/open-source-leg/>`__)  involved 
in walking over different terrain types. The task requires learning the dynamics and control of a powered prosthetic leg that has its own controller. 
This is similar to how people with limb loss learn to adapt to a prosthetic leg over time. This task also requires navigation over different terrain 
with increasing difficulty.

Objective
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Traverse over different terrain types with the :ref:`myoLeg` and a prosthetic leg(`OSL <https://neurobionics.robotics.umich.edu/research/wearable-robotics/open-source-leg/>`__). 
Randomization will take place for challenge difficulty level. For example, the terrain type might change with added obstacles.

    Example of increasing difficulty of obstacles




**Learning interactions with prosthetic leg**


The primary way to interact with the prosthetic leg is via socket interaction forces on the residual limb (which are provided 
in the observations). A state-based impedance controller would provide the commands to move the prosthetic limb and participants 
are provided with the corresponding APIs to update the impedance controller.


For the task realism, there are no direct observations and control over the prosthetic leg. Angles, angular velocities and torque 
of the prosthetic leg will not be available in the observations. Similarly, there is no commanded position, velocity or torques 
for the prosthetic leg.




Action Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Muscles control values for :ref:`myoLeg` are given as continuous values between  :math:`[-1, 1]`. Normalization to a range of :math:`[0, 1]` is done in the environment 
according to the equation:

.. math::

    1 / ( 1 + exp(-5 * (muscleCtrl - 0.5) ) )


For participants that do not wish to use this normalization feature, it can be done during environment initialization with:

:code:`env = gym.make(myoChallengeOslRunFixed-v0‚Äù, normalize_act=False)`


where in this case, the control range of the muscles are set between :math:`[0, 1]` without any normalization performed.

The action space only includes the control of the muscles in the biological leg and residual muscles of the leg on the prosthetic side, with a total of 54 dimensions.
To control the prothetic leg `OSL <https://neurobionics.robotics.umich.edu/research/wearable-robotics/open-source-leg/>`__, 
commanded torque values are generated by an embedded state machine. Refer to the section on :ref:`challenge24_state_machine` for more information.

**Description of observations**

    - Terrain type codes are given as:

        - FLAT = 0
        - HILLY = 1
        - ROUGH = 2
        - STAIRS = 3

    - Socket forces

        - Represented as a 3-DOF force vector. Note that the direction of the force sensor is from the bottom of the socket projecting to the residual limb (i.e. the vertical axis force into the residual limb is negative). Processing of the observations is left to the participant‚Äôs discretion.
    
    - Height Map

        - The height map is a 10x10 grid (flattened to a 100x1), centered around the center of the MyoOSL model. This is a simple representation of a visual input of the terrain around the model.


.. _challenge24_state_machine:

State Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A simple 4-state state machine is created to track the gait phase of the prosthetic leg. Each state contains the gain parameters 
for an impedance controller, which in turn, provides the required torques to the prosthetic actuators. The code for the state machine 
is released together with MyoChallenge. Interested participants are invited to examine the code at 
`myoosl_control <https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite/blob/dev/myosuite/envs/myo/assets/leg/myoosl_control.py>`__


Default parameters of the impedance controller are taken from `finite_state_machine <https://opensourceleg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/finite_state_machine.html>`__


Gait phases in the state machine are divide into:

    1. Early Stance (e_stance)
    2. Late Stance (l_stance)
    3. Early Swing (e_swing)
    4. Late Swing (l_swing)


List of states variables:

    - States

        - ["e_stance", "l_stance", "e_swing", "l_swing"]

    - Impedance controller parameters (for both knee and ankle actuators)

        - Stiffness
        - Damping
        - Target angle

    - State transition thresholds

        - Load
        - Knee angle
        - Knee velocity
        - Ankle angle
        - Ankle velocity

Participants are expected to modify the state paramters of the OSL state machine to tackle this challenge. Given that there are multiple terrain types in the MyoChallenge,
we provide a structure that allows 4 sets of state paramters to be uploaded to the state machine. Participants can then freely switch between paramter sets during each episode by calling the required function.

More details of the functions are here below:

- upload_osl_param(dict_of_dict) `upload_osl_param <https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite/blob/main/myosuite/envs/myo/myochallenge/run_track_v0.py#L717>`__
    - This function expects a dictionary of dictionary containing state parameter values
    - Dictionary overview: top_level_dict[x][y][z][val]
        - top_level_dict[x], where x = [0,1,2,3], which are integers
        - y = {'e_stance', 'l_stance', 'e_swing', 'l_swing'}, which are string values denoting the gait phase
        - z = {'gains', 'threshold'}, which are categories of the state parameters
        - val = {'knee_stiffness', 'knee_damping', 'knee_target_angle', 'ankle_stiffness', 'ankle_damping', 'ankle_target_angle'} *(for gains)* and {'load', 'knee_angle', 'knee_velocity', 'ankle_angle', 'ankle_velocity} *(for thresholds)*
    - Note that not all parameters are used at every state. It is recommended to examine the default structure `here <https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite/blob/main/myosuite/envs/myo/assets/leg/myoosl_control.py#L181>`__ for more information.

- change_osl_mode(mode=0) `change_osl_mode <https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite/blob/main/myosuite/envs/myo/myochallenge/run_track_v0.py#L725>`__
    - This function changes the paramter set that the OSL state machine currently using. Do note that this change is immediate and the impedance controller will generate torques using the new paramter set at the next timestep.


Testing environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To increase the accessibility of the task, two set of testing environment is provided for participants to familiarise themselves with the tasks. 
Please note that the variation parameters are subject to change in the actual evaluation environment.

The two environments are :code:`myoChallengeOslRunRandom-v0` and :code:`myoChallengeOslRunFixed-v0` and can be accessed via :code:`env = gym.make(‚ÄúmyoChallengeOslRunRandom-v0‚Äù, normalize_act=False)`

The :code:`myoChallengeOslRunFixed-v0` environment is a simplified version of the :code:`myoChallengeOslRunRandom-v0` environment for participants to begin with, with a flat ground, but 100m track

The :code:`myoChallengeOslRunRandom-v0` similarly includes a 100 meters track, with a 20m initial stretch of flat ground, and the remaining 80m of increasingly difficult terrain

The environment in evaluation will be similar to the :code:`myoChallengeOslRunRandom-v0` environment

Both environments can be customized for ML or non-ML usage. For participants using ML-based methods, the action space can be set to between [-1 to 1] for both training and your submission with the normalize_act 
argument during environment creation. For participants using non-ML based methods, setting normalize_act=False would provide you with the muscle action space to be between [0 to 1]

During training, you can set this option with env = gym.make(env_name, normalize_act=True) for the action space [-1 to 1] and normalize_act=False for action space [0 to 1]



Success Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    - The performance will be evaluated on multiple episoids under varying conditions to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. The performance will be assessed based on their average outcome across episoids.
    - The controller needs to walk for at least 20 meters before considered for ranking without falling


Ranking Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual model performance is evaluated in terms of the following criterias. Please note that the evaluation process will follow a hierarchical approach, 
where the first criterion is the primary determinant of success. Only in cases where candidates are tied based on the first criterion will the second criterion be considered. 


    1. Average distance travelled (ranked in descending order)
    2. Average time of completion (ranked in ascending order)
    3. Minimum physiological criteria (Pain) : Measured by the average amount of overextension torque on each rotational joint of MyoLeg as a representation of pain
    4. Minimum total muscle activation: Measured by the total muscle activation during the task to estimate metabolic power
